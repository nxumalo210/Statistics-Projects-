**Overview:**
This repository contains files from a course I took in completion of my masters degree in data science. The course was Statistics and we had two projects. One was to code a decision tree classifier and a random forest model to classify data as either spam or ham.

**Documents Attached**
The two Python notebooks contain files that show each of these classfiers as well as certain metrics used to determine how well they both worked.
